          <li> <a href = "rates.html"> Rate Measurement Assignment: </a> For this assignment, a program that analyzed
            birth and death rate populations of two types of animals. The birth and death 
            rates were measured over time, and a graph that displayed the number of the two 
            animals in each population was made. The number of animals in each population were 
            calculated from the birth and death rates of the two animal populations. </li>

            that read and analyzed data from a dataset was created. Simple data analysis 
            was performed, rows and columns were viewed and edited, and histograms were created.
            The code was created in Python. </li>
