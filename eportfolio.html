          <li> <a href="alphadatarhoprojectcode.html"> System Design Project Code</a> </li>  This was a collaborative assignment where a system needed to be
        designed and coded. My group chose to design a monitoring health system and decided to code the system in Python. This
        is the code we worked on for our final project. I coded a blood pressure monitor,
        and my project team member coded a blood glucose monitor.
